## Future Enhancements:

1. Search and Filter
- Search by keyword (e.g., “Fëanor” or “Rings of Power”).
- Filter by era (Years of the Trees, First Age, Second Age, etc.) or by region (Valinor, Beleriand, etc.).
- Filter by character/faction (Noldor, Dúnedain, etc.).
2. Drill-Down Detail
- When a user clicks on an event, they can see a more in-depth description with images (like maps of Beleriand), quotes from Tolkien’s texts, genealogical charts, etc.
3. Interactive Timeline View
- A timeline that you can scroll through horizontally. Clicking on an event bubble (or marker) pops up details.
4. Map Integration using a library like Leaflet
- A “world map” view (for Middle-earth, Beleriand, Aman) where pinned locations correspond to events. Clicking a pin opens event info.
5. Cross-Referencing & Linking
- Show “related events” on the event’s detail page as clickable links, so a user can jump between connected milestones easily.
6. Genealogical / Character Trees
- Visual representation of who’s who, letting you click a character to see all events they’re involved in.
7. Personal Note-Taking
- Users could bookmark or add notes to an event (useful for readers doing in-depth study).
8. Implement character/location pages
